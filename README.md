# CVPacman
This is a variation of Pacman that uses computer vision to track movements of a small green object and uses it for the game input. I used the open source computer vision library OpenCV for the feature detection and a lot of the code for the game itself have been sourced from the Pygame documentation site which I then adapted.

The project is coded in Python3 and OpenCV and pygame are the major non-standard libraries used.


I did this as a project for my tangible computing course at the University of Alberta. My partner Du Quifeng helped me with the game mechanics while I focused on the computer vision aspect.
